Instructions
The examination will consist of 2 questions.
Total time to complete the coding challenge (both questions) is 30 mins. Please allocate your time accordingly.
Please make sure you have a good and stable internet connection and power source. The coding challenge cannot be paused once it begins.
We strongly recommend using a programming language which is more suitable for the role you are applying for.
Please write your code within the function provided. The code editor also includes Template Code. DO NOT EDIT that section of the code, doing so will fail your submission.
You can create custom test cases and test your code for different edge cases an unlimited number of times before submission.
You cannot edit the code once you click Submit.
Please take the practice test before your formal attempt. The practice test has been allotted more time than the actual test so that you can familiarize yourself with the provided coding environment and challenge format.
Note: We will test your code against hidden test cases after your submission, therefore please make sure to test your solutions carefully before submitting. Please also remove any print statements before submitting your solution.
